                        The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood
                        your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs.</p>
